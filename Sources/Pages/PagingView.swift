 The base class that describes a paging view and its behavior.

 The paging view is internally a `ScrollView` with an attached `DragGesture` that will determine
 the scroll view's content offset based on user interaction. The paging view's width is recorded via
 preference keys and used on the `PageGeometry` to calculate offsets.
